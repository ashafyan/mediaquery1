                    <p>The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC,
                         with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I of Urartu at the western extreme of the Ararat Plain.
                         Erebuni was "designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.
                          By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance.
                           The city was mostly depopulated by the Great Surgun of 1603-05,
                            when the Safavid Empire forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of Armenians to Iran.
                             In 1679, the city was mostly destroyed by an earthquake, and then rebuilt on a smaller scale.
                              In 1828, Yerevan became part of the Russian Empire, which led to the repatriation of Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated in the 17th century.
                               After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area.
                                The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century while Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union.
                                 In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia's principal cultural,
                                  artistic, and industrial center, as well as becoming the seat of national government. </p>

                    <h1>Etymology</h1>
                    <p>

                        The "birth certificate" of Yerevan at the Erebuni Fortress—a cuneiform inscription left by
                         King Argishti I of Urartu on a basalt stone slab about the foundation of the city in 782 BCE
                        
                        "YEREVAN" (ԵՐԵՒԱՆ) in an inscription from Kecharis, dating back to 1223[30]
                        See also: Names of Yerevan in different languages
                        The exact origin of the name is unknown.
                         One theory regarding the origin of Yerevan's name is the city was named after the Armenian king,
                          Yervand (Orontes) IV, the last ruler of Armenia from the Orontid dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat.
                           However, it is likely that the city's name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni,
                            which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I.
                             "Erebuni" may derive from the Urartian word for "to take" or "to capture,
                              meaning that the fortress's name could be interpreted as "capture," "conquest," or "victory."
                               As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one,
                                the name eventually evolved into Yerevan (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan).
                                 Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni:</p>
